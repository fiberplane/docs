# Setting up Providers

Providers are full-stack plugins in Fiberplane that allow you to pull in live data directly from your infrastructure data sources into your Notebooks.

## Add a data source

Your data sources can be added from the Studio using direct access (if your data sources URL are open) or using the `data_sources.yaml` file that is then passed in the Docker or Kubernetes configuration. Hereâ€™s an example configuration

```yaml
# data_sources.yaml
#
# Replace the following line with the name of the data source
- name: prometheus-prod
  description: Prometheus (Production)
  providerType: prometheus
  config:
    # Replace the following line with your Prometheus URL and port
    url: http://prometheus:9090
		# If accessing your data source requires authentication - add the token below
		token: <TOKEN>
```

## Data Source Names

Note that data source names (such as `prometheus-prod` in the example above) must follow the [Fiberplane name format](Configuration%20help%20FAQ%2018941c30bc32404785f767ab1892c0ce.md). Data source names must also be unique per proxy.

Currently the following Provider types are supported:
