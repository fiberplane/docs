If you‚Äôre an SRE or infrastructure engineer - chances are you spend much of your work time in your shell. Besides querying providers from the Fiberplane notebook, you can easily send your shell comand and output data to a notebook to examine and share with your colleagues.

You can achieve this with the `run` or `shell` commands in the Fiberplane CLI tool.

The `fp run` command will run your specified command in a subshell and send the output to a specified notebook.

The `fp shell` command will start recording and broadcasting your shell session to a specified notebook. It is useful for peer debugging sessions or simply when you want to have an easily accessible command history log for debugging documentation.

### Initial setup

Make sure you have the Fiberplane CLI installed and you‚Äôre logged in. See: [CLI](doc:cli) for installation instructions.

## Run `fp run`

You can now run your shell command and send the output to the notebook.

```bash
fp run <YOUR_SHELL_COMMAND> -- [ARGS_OF_YOUR_SHELL_COMMAND]
```

Note the `--` supplied before a shell command argument. This is so you can
separate flags and arguments intended for the `fp` command and for the shell command you intend to run.

Fiberplane CLI creates a subshell and runs your command, capturing the
timestamp, the working directory, the command, and the output, and piping this data to the notebook.

You can now share the status of your pods and services directly into the notebook by running something like:

```bash
‚ùØ fp run podman logs <pod_id>
```

And here‚Äôs how that will look like in the notebook:

### Rich output

Currently all of the commands and their output is sent to a simple code cell.

Large text outputs such as logs are easier to parse and read in a dedicated UI as opposed to in a stream of text. Fiberplane will recognize some of these commands and will apply the appropriate formatting for logs (currently supported for Kubernetes and Github Actions logs).

## Run `fp shell`

You can now start recording and broadcasting your shell session to a specified notebook.

```bash
fp shell [OPTIONS] <NOTEBOOK_ID>
```

Fiberplane CLI will establish a secure channel and will start broadcasting your shell commands and their output to the notebook live. Each new command will extend the cell and append the result.

Hit CTRL-D to exit the recorded session and stop the recording. The notebook will save the start and end times of the recorded shell session.

> `fp shell` will only work with non-interactive shell programs (e.g.:
> it will not display vim in there)
