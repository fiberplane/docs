This page explains how the interactions between Fiberplane Studio and a provider happen to interactively add cells to a notebook. It does _not_ touch at all how to write a provider.

You should know what a notebook and cells are in Fiberplane context.

In the following page, a few words are important to define:

- **Data Source**: a data source is a single configured instance of a provider. For example, you can configure 2 Prometheus data sources with the Prometheus Provider, each talking to a different instance.
- **Third Party Resource**: the external resource the data source is configured to talk to. For example, for the Prometheus provider, the third-party resource is the actual instance of Prometheus.
- **SlashCommand**: a command that gets activated from typing `/` in a notebook.
- **Blob**, **ProviderRequest**: data types from the [provider protocol](../reference/protocol.md)

## Summary sequence diagram

In the sequence diagram below, all "critical" sections are named after one of the functions of the
[provider protocol](doc:provider-protocol-reference).

## Adding data sources

Before Studio can allow users to run actions connected to a third party resource, it needs to know about the available data sources. There are 2 ways a provider can get registered to create data sources.

### Built-in Fiberplane providers

When Fiberplane builds and adds a provider integration first hand, we guarantee that Studio will know about it and be able to create commands and data sources from the provider.  In order to add a data source in Studio, you can follow the [Adding a data source](doc:quickstart) tutorial.

### Custom providers (through Fiberplane Daemon)

Fiberplane allows you to use your custom providers in your workspace, using Fiberplane Daemon to proxy the communication between your own WebAssembly provider and Fiberplane Studio. When starting, Fiberplane Daemon will automatically tell Fiberplane Studio about the data sources that are configured with `fpd` configuration file.

## Lifecycle of data source interaction

### Listing and choosing associated slash command

Once a data source is added to a notebook, Fiberplane Studio will use `get_supported_query_types` call to list all the commands/requests that the backing provider supports. This query returns a list of queries with their names, and the input schema of the query (the list of field names and types to fill to make a valid query).

Once a slash command is chosen by a user, Studio expands the input schema into input fields to call the provider.

### Invoking the provider and Showing results

Once the input of a command is filled, any user can "Run" the cell in order to make the data source do its magic. When a user hits "Run", Studio actually serializes the fields into a `ProviderRequest` and uses that to call the `invoke2` method of the data source to obtain results.

#### Data sources return Blobs

Data sources are allowed to return a `Blob` of any MIME type to an invocation. Most of the times the MIME type will be unknown to Studio, so extra exchanges between Studio and the data source need to happen; but a few MIME type is special, because Studio already knows exactly how to render those blobs in a notebook: `application/vnd.fiberplane.cells` is an array of formatted `fiberplane::models::Cell` that will immediately get rendered by Studio.

#### Studio asks how to create cells

More often than not, data sources will return specific Blobs that Studio cannot natively deal with, e.g.  `application/vnd.fiberplane.providers.cloudwatch.query-results`. In that case Studio needs to know how to display the results in the notebook.

Studio will call `create_cells` on the data source, sending back the `Blob` it received. The data source can then use the query_type information as well as the Blob in order to return a list of `fiberplane::models::Cell` that Studio can then natively use to show the results in a pretty fashion in the notebook.

#### The case of data-heavy cells (data extraction)

Cell types in `fiberplane::models::Cell` usually own their underlying data. For example, a `TextCell` structure will embed the actual text that should be displayed within it.

A few cell types do _not_ own their underlying data, mostly to avoid sending back and forth huge payloads to describe the cells. Currently the main cells that do not own their data are the [Log Cell](./TODO) and the [Graph Cell](./TODO). Instead of having an array of events or an array of timeseries within, they use a property called `data-links` to describe where Studio should
find the relevant data for the Cell.

When you start creating a Provider, you will want to use `self` for the location of the underlying data, which tells Studio "The data you want for the log/graph cell is exactly the response from the current slash command the user did".

But Studio also expects the data to follow specific MIME types to be used in the cells: `application/vnd.fiberplane.events` for Log cells, and `application/vnd.fiberplane.timeseries` for Graph cells. Most of the time, the data returned from the invocation will not match that specific format (it will be a provider-specific blob like `application/vnd.fiberplane.providers.cloudwatch.query-results`). So how can Studio obtain the relevant data for a Log or Graph cell out of custom blobs?  This is what the `extract_data` call is supposed to solve.

When Studio wants to display a Cell that uses a `data-link` to find its data, Studio will:

- read the MIME type to extract from the data-link (usually `application/...events` or `...timeseries`),
- read the location of the cell to extract data from (usually `self`), and
- call `extract_data` with the target MIME type on the data-source that owns the cell (so usually the same cell than the one that gave the Log/Graph cell in the earlier `create_cells` call)

### Results in notebook

Once Studio did all the calls to obtain interactive cells in the notebook, the underlying data gets synchronized with our backend, and the state of the cells and the notebook gets shared between all users of the notebook so everyone can look at the data and interact with it in front of everyone!
