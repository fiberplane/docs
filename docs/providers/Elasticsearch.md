Write and run Lucene queries, and show Elasticsearch logs alongside the rest of your content.

# Setup

In order to enable Elasticsearch Provider in Fiberplane you need to either add it via direct access (for an openly accessible URL) or add it as a valid entry in the `data_source.yaml` configuration.

The `data_sources.yaml` format for adding a Elasticsearch Provider looks like this:

```yaml
# data_sources.yaml
#
# Replace the following line with the name of the data source
- name: elasticsearch-dev
  description: Elasticsearch (Dev)
  providerType: elasticsearch
  config:
    # Replace the following line with your Elasticsearch URL (including Basic Auth) and port
    url: http://username:password@elasticsearch:9200
    # If accessing your Elasticsearch data source requires an API key - add it here
    token: <ApiKey>
```

# Usage

## Create an Elasticsearch table

1. Hit `/` and select “Elasticsearch” from the available options
2. Write a Lucene query you want to run to pull Elasticsearch logs.
3. Hit CTRL + ENTER or ⌘↩︎ if you’re on a Mac to run it.

## Chart time range

By default, the query will follow the Notebook time range (configured at the top of the Notebook) so all of your charts in a notebook use the same time range. As you change the Notebook time range it will update all of your charts automatically.

You can also set a chart-specific time range overrides by clicking the link icon at the top of the chart.

## Expand, select, highlight, and export records

Once logs are loaded you can:

- Expand to show them in a more readable view;
- Select interesting records;
- Highlight them for the rest of your team;
- Export them into a separate table so they are archived and do not get affected by time range changes in the notebook.

## Add columns

By default, the logs output shows in a full document body output. However, you can configure this to show only the fields you select. Click `+ Add columns` and select or unselect the fields you want to see/hide. The selected fields will show as columns in a horizontal view.
