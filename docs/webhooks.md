Fiberplane Webhooks allow you to receive JSON payloads right to your own programs anytime
an event happens on your Fiberplane workspace. Once that is the case, we will send you a
`POST` payload to your configured webhook URL.

Webhooks are configured on a per-workspace basis. An unlimited amount of webhooks can be configured.

## Events

When setting up a webhook, you can select which categories of events you want to receive. You can
subscribe to an unlimited amount of categories. You will always be automatically subscribed to the
`ping` category, which only includes the `ping` event.

For a complete list of available webhook events and their payloads,
see [Webhook events and payloads](doc:webhook-events).

## `ping` event

Upon creation or updating of a webhook, we will send you a simple `ping` event to check whenever
your endpoint is set up correctly. If the endpoint fails to respond with a `2xx` status code,
the webhook will still be created/updated but will be set to the disabled state.

To see further information why the delivery of the ping event failed, you can take a look at the most
recent delivery after your webhook creation/update. You need to fix the issue on your end and re-deliver
the `ping` event before trying to re-enable the webhook.

Once the `ping` event gets successfully handled by your endpoint, you can update the webhook and enable
it again. This will send a new `ping` event, which your endpoint will now handle correctly and thus
your webhook will be enabled and receive payloads.

For more information about the `ping` event and the payload it sends with it,
see the [`ping` event](doc:webhook-events#ping) documentation.
