Fiberplane Webhooks allow you to receive JSON payloads right to your own programs anytime
an event happens on your Fiberplane workspace. Once that is the case, we will send you a
`POST` payload to your configured webhook URL.

Webhooks are configured on a per-workspace basis. An unlimited amount of webhooks can be configured.

Creating a webhook is a two-step process, first having to set up the subscriber which receives
Fiberplane's payloads and then configuring Fiberplane to send the payloads to it.

In this document we will create our own example webhook subscriber which will receive deliveries.

## Writing a subscriber

A subscriber is an HTTP server which will receive deliveries from Fiberplane. The subscriber needs to:

- Be able to receive HTTP `POST` requests using `HTTP/1.1`
- Be able to read the `application/json` body.
  **Note**: Fiberplane will send deliveries with a custom `Content-Type`: `application/vnd.fiberplane.webhook+json`
- Be not more than five redirects away

For the example of this tutorial, we will use this simple Python 3 server:

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/delivery", methods=["POST"])
def handle_delivery():
    payload = request.get_json(force=True)

    print(f"Received delivery from Fiberplane: {payload}")
    return "OK", 200
```

Run the above example with

```shell
$ python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=62113
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:62113
 * Running on http://172.18.119.222:62113
```

Now the server will listen for network wide incoming connections on port `62113`.
However, we will not be able to reach it as we're most likely behind a NAT.

We can work around this by using an HTTP tunnel such as [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/), [Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/tailscale-funnel/)
or [`tunnel.pyjam.as`](https://tunnel.pyjam.as/). The last one only requires Wireguard and
is a simple one-liner to get set up and running:

```shell
$ curl https://tunnel.pyjam.as/62113 > tunnel.conf && wg-quick up ./tunnel.conf
You can now access http://0.0.0.0:62113 on https://mwk8xc.tunnel.pyjam.as/ âœ¨
```

## Setting up the webhook

You can create a webhook using Fiberplane Studio or using the `fp` CLI.

To set up a webhook in Fiberplane Studio, go to your workspace settings and click `Webhooks`.
From there, click on `+ Add webhook` and fill in the fields described below.

To set up a webhook with the `fp` CLI, simply type `fp webhooks create` and fill in the questions
it asks you. The fields are described below.

## Endpoint URL

The endpoint URL is the URL to which Fiberplane will send deliveries using an HTTP `POST` request.

Since we're developing locally for the purpose of this tutorial, we'll set it to the URL which
`tunnel.pyjam.as` gave us above, followed by `/delivery`. Example: `https://mwk8xc.tunnel.pyjam.as/delivery`

If you are configuring a custom endpoint which uses HTTPS, please ensure you are running TLS 1.2 or higher. The
certificate must be trusted by the Mozilla Trust Store and cannot be self-signed.

## Endpoint URL Limitations

- Your endpoint needs to respond within 30 seconds
- Your endpoint URL must resolve to a global reachable IP address (not `127.0.0.1`)
- A maximum of 5 redirects will be followed
- The endpoint may be either HTTP or HTTPS
- If HTTPS, self-signed certificates are not allowed. The certificate must be trusted by the Mozilla Trust Store

## Events

You can select a list of categories for which your endpoint will receive deliveries. You cannot
select individual events for which you want to receive payloads, for example you can't subscribe
to only the `frontmatter.update` event but only to the whole `frontmatter` category, which also includes
the `frontmatter.delete` event.

You will always be automatically subscribed to the `ping` category, which only includes the `ping` event.
For more information about this very specific event, see [below](#ping-event).

For a complete list of available webhook events and their payloads,
see [Webhook events and payloads](doc:webhook-events).

## `ping` event

Upon creation or updating of a webhook, we will send you a simple `ping` event to check whenever
your endpoint is set up correctly. If the endpoint fails to respond with a `2xx` status code,
the webhook will still be created/updated but will be set to the disabled state.

To see further information why the delivery of the ping event failed, you can take a look at the most
recent delivery after your webhook creation/update. You need to fix the issue on your end and re-deliver
the `ping` event before trying to re-enable the webhook.

Once the `ping` event gets successfully handled by your endpoint, you can update the webhook and enable
it again. This will send a new `ping` event, which your endpoint will now handle correctly and thus
your webhook will be enabled and receive payloads.

For more information about the `ping` event and the payload it sends with it,
see the [`ping` event](doc:webhook-events#ping) documentation.
