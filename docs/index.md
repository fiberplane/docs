# Fiberplane Documentation

Fiberplane Studio is available for the [Web](https://fiberplane.com/).

To get started go to [https://fiberplane.com/](https://fiberplane.com/) and log in with your Fiberplane account (currently available only for Google Workspace users). You can also go right away to your notebook by typing [fp.new](https://fp.new/) in your URL, however, to save and store your notebook, you will need to log in.

## How Fiberplane works

Fiberplane Studio allows you to query, visualize, and understand metrics and logs in your infrastructure.

Whenever you execute a query in the notebook:

1. The query is forwarded to the Fiberplane Proxy in your cluster;
2. The Proxy then queries the Provider data source (e.g. your Prometheus or Elastic instance);
3. When the Provider returns the data, the Proxy processes, encrypts, and then returns it back to the Studio.
