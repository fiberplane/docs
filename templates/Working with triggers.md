# Working with triggers

Triggers enable you to invoke Fiberplane Templates and create notebooks via a Webhook call. This can be used to automatically create notebooks from alerts, deploy notifications, or connect it to your customer support tools.

## Creating a trigger

To create a trigger you will need the ID of the template you want the trigger be pointing to (you can find that using `fp templates list` command).

Then:

```bash
fp triggers create --template-id <TEMPLATE_ID>
```

The command will return the trigger URL used to invoke it that will look something like this (save this URL!):

```bash
https://fiberplane.com/api/triggers/:id/:secret_key
```

## Invoking a trigger

You can now add the trigger URL to anything that is capable of sending HTTP POST requests (e.g.: Zapier Webhooks). The POST request should include in the payload JSON object the data that the template is expected to receive.

Let’s take our earlier example template:

```bash
function(
    incidentName
)
  fp.notebook
    .new('Incident Response for: ' + incidentName)
    .addCells([
      c.text('Hello World!'),
    ])

```

After having created a trigger URL for this template we can send a simple POST request with a JSON body:

```bash
POST https://fiberplane.com/api/triggers/:id/:secret_key
Content-type: application/json
{
    "incidentName": "API Outage"
}
```

And a new notebook with a title “API Outage” will be created!
